Common Distributions to Consider

*    Normal Distribution: A symmetrical bell-shaped distribution, often suitable for data clustered around a mean.
*    Weibull Distribution: Useful for modeling time-to-failure data and various other phenomena.
*    Lognormal Distribution: Suitable for data with a positive skew.
*    Gamma Distribution: Used for modeling waiting times and other positive-valued data.
*    Poisson Distribution: Appropriate for count data, such as the number of events in a given time period.
